# Project 3: Spots

This project, called spots, was to create an interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their profile.

All the elements are to be displayed correctly on popular screen sizes on desktops and mobile devices.
The task was to create an interactive webpage where the user can edit, add images, and like images using the prototpe on Figma. The project visually matches the design on Figma and is displayed correctly for all
screen resolutions, as shown in the design.

Spots was a project that allowed the coder to get very detailed with copying a prototype using Figma.

## Tech Stack -

HTML, CSS, BEM Methodologie, and Responsoive Design were used.
Stylesheets do not use tag selectors to set CSS rules.
No more than two selectors are nested in any CSS rule.
Stylesheets and images are located in separate folders and organized into
blocks. Files are all organized within a Flat BEM file structure.
Blocks are imported into the corresponding page file. CSS rules for elements
and modifiers are declared in the corresponding CSS block file.
Modifiers do not contain duplicate styles of the element or block being
modified. They contain only the changing properties.

Absolute positioning is only used in instances where static or relative
positioning can't be used.
For elements with absolute positioning, top and bottom declarations are not
used simultaneously, and neither are left and right .

Created media queries using responsive dimension 627 by 1227 as my baseline for all of the blocks.
Breakpoints are grouped together. The maximum width is set for the content according to the design
